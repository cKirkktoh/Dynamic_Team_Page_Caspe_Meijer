# Kirk and Nik's Quatro Brand Team Page

A dynamic webpage about none other than the new Quatro crew! Sure we have to make a website for the brand, but the people who worked on it deserve the spotlight too. 

On this page, users will find a brief greeting from the brand and can get started by clicking on the buttons! Each button features one of the awesome Quatro team members, and you can learn a little more about us...

## Plan

Create HTML and Javascript with basic CSS (Main functions, buttons, code for photos and content) > add photos and content (i.e. names, bios, introduction) > create visual structure with css > visual styling such as colours, spacing, etc

!!! Important !!!
Maintain flow of pulls and commits, try best to keep back and forth with approval as much as possible.

## Usage

Read instructions on page, and then proceed to click buttons and learn about teammates.

Used to teach our users about the 2 guys who brought Quatro back to life.
